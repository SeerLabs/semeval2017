                    "this arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.", 
                    "for example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.",

                    "as noted earlier, nuclear weapons testing, primarily in the high-latitude regions of the northern hemisphere, throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s introduced large amounts of tritium into the atmosphere, especially the stratosphere.",

                    "there is a downward propagation of the tritium maximum from the surface (1960s) to 400 meters (1980s), which corresponds to a deepening rate of approximately 18 meters per year.",

                    "also evident was the decrease in tritium in the deep western boundary current by a factor of 10 from the labrador sea to the tropics, which is indicative of loss to ocean interior due to turbulent mixing and recirculation.", 
                    "results indicated that the tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the fremantle bay (approximately 0.40 bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters.", 
                    "results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the indian ocean.", 
                    "as for water vapor, the tritium concentration was approximately one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15 bq/liter).", 
                    "therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium concentrations in the vapor were concluded to be a direct consequence of the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on latitudinal change).",

                    "layer 1 is the shallowest layer and includes the deepest, ventilated layer in winter; it has received tritium via radioactive fallout and lost some due to advection and/or vertical diffusion and contains approximately 28% of the total amount of tritium.",

                    "the largest tritium concentrations were found in 1963 at all the sampled locations throughout these rivers and correlate well with the peak concentrations in precipitation due to the nuclear bomb tests in 1962.",

                    "therefore, the basin tritium concentration becomes a function of the residence times within the basin, sinks (radioactive decay) or sources of tritium, and the input function.", 
                    "for the ohio river, the tritium data indicated that about 40% of the flow was composed of precipitation with residence times of less than 1 year (in the ohio basin) and older waters consisted of residence times of about 10 years.",

                    "radiocarbon dating (also referred to as carbon dating or carbon-14 dating) is a method for determining the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon (14c), a radioactive isotope of carbon.", 
                    "the resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis; animals then acquire 14c by eating the plants.", 
                    "when the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of 14c it contains begins to decrease as the 14c undergoes radioactive decay.", 
                    "he published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include 14c as well as non-radioactive carbon.", 
                    "the results were summarized in a paper in science in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied it would be possible to date materials containing carbon of organic origin.", 
                    "carbon dioxide produced in this way diffuses in the atmosphere, is dissolved in the ocean, and is taken up by plants via photosynthesis.", 
                    "in addition, about 1% of the carbon atoms are of the stable isotope 13c.", 
                    "because 14c decays at a known rate, the proportion of radiocarbon can be used to determine how long it has been since a given sample stopped exchanging carbon \u2013 the older the sample, the less 14c will be left.", 
                    "the different elements of the carbon exchange reservoir vary in how much carbon they store, and in how long it takes for the 14c generated by cosmic rays to fully mix with them.", 
                    "the atmosphere, which is where 14c is generated, contains about 1.9% of the total carbon in the reservoirs, and the 14c it contains mixes in less than seven years.", 
                    "the ratio of 14c to 12c in the atmosphere is taken as the baseline for the other reservoirs: if another reservoir has a lower ratio of 14c to 12c, it indicates that the carbon is older and hence that some of the 14c has decayed.", 
                    "the ocean surface is an example: it contains 2.4% of the carbon in the exchange reservoir, but there is only about 95% as much 14c as would be expected if the ratio were the same as in the atmosphere.", 
                    "the time it takes for carbon from the atmosphere to mix with the surface ocean is only a few years, but the surface waters also receive water from the deep ocean, which has more than 90% of the carbon in the reservoir.", 
                    "these organisms contain about 1.3% of the carbon in the reservoir; sea organisms have a mass of less than 1% of those on land and are not shown on the diagram.", 
                    "accumulated dead organic matter, of both plants and animals, exceeds the mass of the biosphere by a factor of nearly 3, and since this matter is no longer exchanging carbon with its environment, it has a 14c/12c ratio lower than that of the biosphere.", 
                    "this fossil fuel effect (also known as the suess effect, after hans suess, who first reported it in 1955) would only amount to a reduction of 0.2% in 14c activity if the additional carbon from fossil fuels were distributed throughout the carbon exchange reservoir, but because of the long delay in mixing with the deep ocean, the actual effect is a 3% reduction.", 
                    "if all this extra 14c had immediately been spread across the entire carbon exchange reservoir, it would have led to an increase in the 14c/12c ratio of only a few per cent, but the immediate effect was to almost double the amount of 14c in the atmosphere, with the peak level occurring in about 1965.", 
                    "the level has since dropped, as this bomb pulse or \"bomb carbon\" (as it is sometimes called) percolates into the rest of the reservoir.", 
                    "the differential uptake of the three carbon isotopes leads to 13c/12c and 14c/12c ratios in plants that differ from the ratios in the atmosphere.", 
                    "since 13c makes up about 1% of the carbon in a sample, the 13c/12c ratio can be accurately measured by mass spectrometry.", 
                    "this increase in 14c concentration almost exactly cancels out the decrease caused by the upwelling of water (containing old, and hence 14c depleted, carbon) from the deep ocean, so that direct measurements of 14c radiation are similar to measurements for the rest of the biosphere.", 
                    "this is probably because the greater surface area of ocean in the southern hemisphere means that there is more carbon exchanged between the ocean and the atmosphere than in the north.", 
                    "similarly, groundwater can contain carbon derived from the rocks through which it has passed.", 
                    "these rocks are usually so old that they no longer contain any measurable 14c, so this carbon lowers the 14c/12c ratio of the water it enters, which can lead to apparent ages of thousands of years for both the affected water and the plants and freshwater organisms that live in it.", 
                    "this is known as the hard water effect because it is often associated with calcium ions, which are characteristic of hard water; other sources of carbon such as humus can produce similar results.", 
                    "volcanic eruptions eject large amounts of carbon into the air.", 
                    "the carbon is of geological origin and has no detectable 14c, so the 14c/12c ratio in the vicinity of the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas.",

                    "plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower 14c/12c ratios: for example, plants on the greek island of santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years.", 
                    "contamination with modern carbon causes a sample to appear to be younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples.", 
                    "if a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years.", 
                    "contamination with old carbon, with no remaining 14c, causes an error in the other direction independent of age \u2013 a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it really is, regardless of the date of the sample.",
