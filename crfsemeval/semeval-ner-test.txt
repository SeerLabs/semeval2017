that	O

In	O

the	O

much	O
a	O
superior	O

that	O

the	O

One	O
must	O
remember,	O
however,	O
that	O

The	O

we	O

the	O

We	O

As	O

the	O

The	O

these	O

the	O

each	O

For	O
instance,	O
the	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

the	O

However,	O
due	O

the	O

This	O

the	O

we	O

both	O

(see	O

we	O
observe	O
that	O

A	O

Even	O
though	O
the	O

it	O
also	O

In	O

The	O
method	O
is	O
conceptually	O

to	O

does	O
not	O

It	O

the	O

We	O
aim	O
at	O
clarifying,	O
via	O

the	O
relation	O

a	O

its	B-KP

(which	O

We	O
show	O
that	O

We	O
believe	O

the	O

It	O

precisely	O
these	O

that	O

define	O
a	O

This	O
observation	O

the	O
remark	O

[2]	O
that	O

both	O

Our	O

the	O

the	O

[8]	O
which	O

The	O

will	O
therefore	O

it	O

Some	O

In	O

Therefore	O

In	O

We	O

Table	O

In	O
fact,	O
there	O
are	O
more	O
decay	B-KP
pairs,	I-KP
since	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
particles	O
in	O
the	O
final	O

can	O
be	O
observed	O
as	O
either	O
pseudoscalar	O
(P)	O
or	O

(V)	O
mesons.	B-KP
	
Note	O
that	O
certain	O
decays	B-KP
are	O
written	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
VV	O
final	O
states,	O
while	O
others	O
are	O
have	O
PP	O
states.	O
	
There	O
are	O
three	O
reasons	O
for	O
this.	O
	
First,	O
some	O
decays	B-KP
involve	O
a	O
final-state	O
π0.	O
	
However,	O
experimentally	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
find	B-KP
the	I-KP
decay	I-KP
vertices	I-KP
of	O
the	O
final	B-KP
particles.	I-KP
	
This	O
is	O
virtually	O
impossible	O
for	O
a	O
π0,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
always	O
use	O
a	O
ρ0.	O
	
Second,	O
some	O
pairs	B-KP
of	I-KP
decays	I-KP
are	O
related	O
by	O
SU(3)	O
in	O
the	O
SM	B-KP
only	O
if	O
an	O
(ss¯)	O
quark	B-KP
pair	I-KP
is	O
used.	O
	
However,	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
P's	O
which	O
are	O
pure	O
(ss¯).	O
	
The	O
mesons	B-KP
η	B-KP
and	O
η′	B-KP
have	O
an	O
(ss¯)	O
component,	O
but	O
they	O
also	O
have	O
significant	O
(uu¯)	O
and	O
(dd¯)	O
pieces.	O
	
As	O
a	O
result	O
the	O
b¯→s¯	O
and	O
b¯→d¯	O
decays	B-KP
are	O
not	O
really	O
related	O
by	O
SU(3)	O
in	O
the	O
SM	B-KP
if	O
the	O
final	O
state	O
involves	O
an	O
η	B-KP
or	O
η′.	B-KP
	
We	O
therefore	O
consider	O
instead	O
the	O
vector	B-KP
meson	I-KP
ϕ	B-KP
which	O
is	O
essentially	O
a	O
pure	O
(ss¯)	O
quark	B-KP
state.	I-KP
	
Finally,	O
we	O
require	O
that	O
both	O
B0	B-KP
and	O
B¯0	B-KP
be	O
able	O
to	O
decay	B-KP
to	I-KP
the	I-KP
final	I-KP
state.	I-KP
	
This	O
cannot	O
happen	O
if	O
the	O
final	O
state	O
contains	O
a	O
single	O
K0	O
(or	O
K¯0)	O
meson.	B-KP
	
However,	O
it	O
can	O
occur	O
if	O
this	O
final-state	B-KP
particle	I-KP
is	O
an	O
excited	B-KP
neutral	I-KP
kaon.	I-KP
	
In	O
this	O
case	O
one	O
decay	O
involves	O
K*0,	B-KP
while	O
the	O
other	O
has	O
K¯*0.	B-KP
	
Assuming	O
that	O
the	O
vector	B-KP
meson	I-KP
is	O
detected	O
via	O
its	O
decay	B-KP
to	I-KP
ψKsπ0	B-KP
(as	O
in	O
the	O
measurement	B-KP
of	I-KP
sin2β	I-KP
via	O
Bd0(t)→J/ψK*),	O
then	O
both	O
B0	B-KP
and	O
B¯0	B-KP
can	O
decay	B-KP
to	O
the	O
same	O
final	O
state.	O
	
It	O
should	O
be	O
noted	O
that	O
BEBC	B-KP
[21]	O
and	O
NOMAD	B-KP
[20]	O
observed	B-KP
a	I-KP
discrepancy	I-KP
between	O
experimental	O
ρ	O

and	O
those	O
estimated	O
with	O
JETSET	B-KP
[16].	O
	
NOMAD	B-KP
[20]	O

retune	B-KP
some	I-KP

the	I-KP

used	O
within	O
JETSET	B-KP
to	O
obtain	B-KP
better	I-KP

Therefore,	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
this	O
analysis	B-KP
events	B-KP
were	I-KP
simulated	I-KP
both	O

the	O

We	O

where	O

(Table	O

The	O
uncertainty	O
introduced	O
by	O
the	O
JETSET	B-KP
parameter	B-KP
settings	I-KP
(which	O
amounts	O
to	O
20%	O

most)	O
affects	O
only	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
η′	O
and	O
ϕ	O
for	O
which	O
no	O
experimental	B-KP

This	O
uncertainty	O
is	O
reflected	O
in	O
the	O

quoted	O
in	O
the	O
table.	O
	
However,	O
since	O
the	O
contribution	O
from	O
η′	O
and	O
ϕ	O
is	O
small,	O
the	O
overall	O

In	O
this	O
Letter,	O
we	O
present	O
results	O
of	O
a	O
relativistic	B-KP
calculation	I-KP
of	I-KP

in	O
the	O
framework	B-KP
of	I-KP
full	I-KP

The	O
full	O
Salpeter	B-KP
equation	I-KP
is	O
a	O
relativistic	B-KP
equation	I-KP
describing	O
a	O
bound	O

Since	O
this	O
method	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
solid	O
basis	O
in	O
quantum	B-KP
field	I-KP
theory,	I-KP
it	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
in	O
describing	B-KP
a	I-KP
bound	I-KP
state	I-KP
which	O
is	O
a	O
relativistic	B-KP
system.	I-KP
	
In	O
a	O
previous	O
paper	O
[16],	O
we	O
solved	B-KP
the	I-KP

Bethe–Salpeter	B-KP

[17],	O
which	O
is	O
also	O
called	O
full	B-KP
Salpeter	I-KP

[18].	O
	
After	O
we	O
solved	B-KP
the	I-KP
full	I-KP
Salpeter	I-KP
equation,	I-KP
we	O
obtained	O
the	O
relativistic	B-KP
wave	I-KP
function	I-KP
of	I-KP
the	I-KP
bound	I-KP

We	O
used	O
this	O

to	O
calculate	B-KP
the	I-KP
average	I-KP
kinetic	I-KP

of	O
the	O
heavy	B-KP

inside	O
a	O

and	O
obtained	B-KP
values	I-KP
which	O
agree	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
recent	O
experiments.	O
	
We	O
also	O
found	O
there	O
that	O
the	O

are	I-KP
quite	I-KP

and	O
cannot	O
be	O
ignored	O
[16].	O
	
In	O
this	O
Letter	O
we	O
use	B-KP
this	I-KP
method	I-KP
to	O
predict	B-KP
the	I-KP

of	I-KP

of	O

Our	O

is	O
to	O
introduce	B-KP

a	O

the	O

One	O

[6].	O
	
In	O
this	O

the	O

The	O

Some	O

These	O

that	O

with	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

compared	O
with	O

In	O
particular,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O

built	O
from	O
very	O

for	O

However,	O
there	O
are	O
problems	O
to	O

solved	O
in	O
SW-SVR.	B-KP
	
Firstly,	O
the	O
prediction	O
performance	O
of	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
sometimes	O
deteriorates	O
despite	O
an	O
increase	O
of	O

In	O
particular,	O
this	O
problem	O
occurred	O
under	O
the	O
conditions	O
that	O
prediction	O
horizons	O
are	O
6	O
h	O
as	O
shown	O
in	O
Fig.	O
3.	O
	
This	O
is	O
because	O
data	O
extracted	O
by	O
D-SDC	B-KP
involves	O
unnecessary	O
training	B-KP
data	I-KP
for	O
highly	O
accurate	O

If	O
D-SDC	B-KP
extracts	O
the	O
same	O
data	O
as	O
the	O
extracted	O
data	O
when	O
training	O
periods	O
are	O
shorter,	O
the	O
prediction	O
performance	O
of	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
never	O
deteriorates	O
due	O
to	O
an	O
increase	O
of	O
training	B-KP
data.	I-KP
	
Therefore,	O
we	O
must	O
review	O
both	O
feature	O
mapping	O
and	O
algorithms	O
of	O
D-SDC	B-KP
so	O
as	O
to	O
avoid	O
extracting	O
unnecessary	O
training	O
data.	O
	
Meanwhile,	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
is	O
based	O
on	O
a	O
combination	B-KP
of	I-KP
several	I-KP
algorithms:	O
kernel	B-KP
approximation,	I-KP
PLS	B-KP
regression,	I-KP
k-means,	B-KP
D-SDC,	B-KP
and	O
linear	B-KP
SVR.	I-KP
	
Moreover,	O
each	O
algorithm	O
has	O
several	O
parameters.	O
	
Therefore,	O
SW-SVR	B-KP
has	O
more	O
varied	O
parameters,	O
and	O
it	O
takes	O
more	O
time	O
to	O
tune	B-KP
the	I-KP
parameters.	I-KP
	
In	O
this	O
experiment,	O
we	O
used	O
a	O

roughly	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
decide	O
the	O
parameters	O
in	O
a	O

However,	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
room	O
for	O
improvement	O
in	O
the	O

by	O
using	O
other	O

However,	O

The	O

An	O

The	O

Polyurea	B-KP
