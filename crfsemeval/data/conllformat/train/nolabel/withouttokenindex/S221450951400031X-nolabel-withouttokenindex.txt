This DT I-NP O
phase NN I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
completed VBN I-VP O
in IN I-PP O
2005. CD I-NP O

Previous JJ I-NP O
contracts NNS I-NP O
had VBD I-VP O
been VBN I-VP O
procured VBN I-VP O
with IN I-PP O
the DT I-NP O
contractor NN I-NP O
providing VBG I-VP O
the DT I-NP O
detailed JJ I-NP I-KP
design. NN I-NP I-KP

For IN I-PP O
this DT I-NP O
system NN I-NP O
the DT B-NP O
design NN I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
undertaken VBN I-VP O
by IN I-PP O
Mott NNP I-NP O
MacDonald. NNP I-NP O

It PRP I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
developed VBN I-VP O
by IN I-PP O
looking VBG I-VP I-KP
at IN I-PP I-KP
the DT I-NP I-KP
systems NNS I-NP I-KP
installed VBD I-VP I-KP
previously RB I-VP I-KP
and CC I-VP I-KP
calculating VBG I-VP I-KP
what WP I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
actually RB I-VP O
required VBN I-VP O
to TO I-VP O
achieve VB I-VP O
cathodic JJ I-NP I-KP
protection NN I-NP I-KP
of IN I-PP I-KP
the DT I-NP I-KP
piers. NN I-NP I-KP

This DT I-NP O
resulted VBD I-VP O
in IN I-PP O
a DT I-NP O
significant JJ I-NP I-KP
reduction NN I-NP I-KP
in IN I-PP I-KP
the DT I-NP I-KP
number NN I-NP I-KP
of IN I-PP I-KP
zones NNS I-NP I-KP
and CC O I-KP
monitoring NN I-NP I-KP
probes. NN I-NP I-KP

The DT I-NP O
varying VBG I-NP I-KP
amounts NNS I-NP I-KP
of IN I-PP I-KP
steelwork NN I-NP I-KP
in IN I-PP O
the DT I-NP O
beams NN I-NP O
had VBD I-VP O
previously RB I-VP O
lead VBN I-VP O
to TO I-VP O
up RB O O
to TO I-VP O
5 CD I-NP O
zones NNS I-NP O
per IN I-PP O
beam, NN I-NP O
with IN I-PP O
multiple JJ I-NP I-KP
layers NNS I-NP I-KP
of IN I-PP I-KP
mesh NN I-NP I-KP
to TO I-VP O
achieve VB I-VP O
the DT I-NP O

On IN I-PP O
review NN I-NP O
of IN I-PP O
the DT I-NP O
data NNS I-NP I-KP
the DT B-NP O
operating NN I-NP O
current JJ I-NP O
density NN I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
similar JJ I-NP O
in IN I-PP O
all DT I-NP O
zones NNS I-NP O
and CC O O
so RB O O
this DT I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
reduced VBN I-VP O
to TO I-VP O
a DT I-NP O
single JJ I-NP O
zone NN I-NP O
per IN I-PP O
beam. NN I-NP O

The DT I-NP O
encapsulation NN I-NP I-KP
was VBD I-VP O
susceptible JJ I-NP O
to TO I-VP O
ASR NNP I-NP I-KP
and CC O O
contained VBD I-VP O
post NN I-NP O
tensioning NN I-NP O
and CC O O
so IN I-PP O
it PRP I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
decided VBN I-VP O
to TO I-VP O
use VB I-VP O
a DT I-NP O
galvanic NN I-NP I-KP
system NN I-NP I-KP
based VBN I-VP O
on IN I-PP O
Galvashield NNP I-NP I-KP
CC NNP I-NP I-KP
anodes VBZ I-VP I-KP
from IN I-PP O
Fosroc. NNP I-NP O

Our PRP$ I-NP O
design NN I-NP O
did VBD I-VP O
not RB I-VP O
include VB I-VP O
an DT I-NP O
option NN I-NP O
to TO I-VP O
allow VB I-VP O
depolarization NN I-NP I-KP
of IN I-PP I-KP
the DT I-NP I-KP
galvanic JJ I-NP I-KP
system, NN I-NP I-KP
but CC O O
the DT I-NP O
contractor NN I-NP O
supplied VBD I-VP O
one, NNS I-NP O
such JJ I-NP O
that IN I-PP O
the DT I-NP O
anodes NNS I-NP O
could MD I-VP O
be VB I-VP O
remotely RB O O
disconnected. JJ I-NP O

The DT I-NP O
control NN I-NP O
unit NN I-NP O
was VBD I-VP O
from IN I-PP O
Electrotech NNP I-NP O
CP NNP I-NP O
and CC O O
operated VBD I-VP O
via IN I-PP O
a DT I-NP O
broadband NN I-NP I-KP
connection NN I-NP I-KP
provided VBN I-VP O
by IN I-PP O
the DT I-NP O
contractor. NN I-NP O
