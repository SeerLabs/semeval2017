The	O

might	O
be	O
the	O
derivation	O

the	O
Dirac	B-KP

The	B-KP
Creutz	I-KP
model	I-KP
[32]	O
suggests	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
consider	O
incorporating	O

the	O

the	O
additional	O
knowledge	O
that	O

instead	O
of	O
particles	O

Recall	O
that	O
up	O

Section	O
2.4,	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
measurement	O

is	O
explicitly	O
discrete.	O
	
In	O
Section	O
2.4,	O
the	O
continuum	O
limit	O
was	O
taken	O
only	O
because	O
our	O
aim	O
was	O
to	O
derive	O
the	O

which	O
is	O
formulated	O
in	O
continuum	O

Of	O

the	O
description	O
of	O
the	O

the	I-KP

in	O
Section	O
2.6	O

entirely	O

there	O

by	O
a	O

Therefore	O
it	O
seems	O

that	O

From	O

Based	O

the	O

the	I-KP

Tack	B-KP
is	O
an	O
important	O
property	O
of	O
a	O

it	O

its	O
ability	O

instantly	O
a	O

The	O

Therefore,	O

important	O
in	O
many	O

we	O

In	O

This	O

Previous	O

For	O
this	O

the	O

It	O

On	O

the	O

the	O

The	O
